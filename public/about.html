<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My Nada Ocama.
  I'm a passionate Web Developer with a strong focus on creating fast, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
  I specialize in front-end development with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. 
  I also have experience with backend technologies such as Node.js and PHP, and I build custom solutions using WordPress. 
  I enjoy turning ideas into fully functional websites that not only look great but also perform smoothly across devices. 
  Whether it's building a site from scratch or improving an existing one, Iâ€™m committed to clean code, creative problem-solving, and delivering results that meet business goals.
